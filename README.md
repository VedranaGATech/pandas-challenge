Module 4 Assignment 

## Conclusion

Charter Schools are outperforming District Schools in all five categories, by a significant margin of 28% when it comes to percent of overall passing grades. Charter schools and District Schools, both record a higher percent of students passing reading compared to percent of students passing math, but Districts schools are still lagging in percent passing reading by 16%.   
 
Schools with great number of students have a downward trend on student grade performance. Class size and teacher:student ration would make a big impact on this conclusion and  helpful with further analysis of this trend. 
 
Higher per student spending does not correlate with better student performance. On the contrary, schools which have spent less per student, are showing greater results in average scores, and passing grades. 
 

Overall, reading skills are shown to score higher than the math skills across all schools, regardless of the school size and per student spending. Our data does not include further socio and economic demographics, which could further influence and explain some of the disparities in our findings. 


## Background

Access was granted to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Our task was to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.
Above conclusion was derived based on the data extracted from the district-wide standardized test results:

District Summary

   Hhigh-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame, including the following:
        Total schools
        Total students
        Total budget
        Average math score
        Average reading score
        % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
        % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
        % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

School Summary

    DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:
        School name
        School type
        Total students
        Total school budget
        Per student budget
        Average math score
        Average reading score
        % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
        % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
        % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

    DataFrame that highlights the top-5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:
        School name
        School type
        Total students
        Total school budget
        Per student budget
        Average math score
        Average reading score
        % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
        % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
        % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

    DataFrame that highlights the bottom-5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:
        School name
        School type
        Total students
        Total school budget
        Per student budget
        Average math score
        Average reading score
        % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
        % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
        % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
    
Math Scores by Grade

    DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Reading Scores by Grade

    DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

Scores by School Spending

    A table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student):
        Average math score
        Average reading score
        % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
        % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
        % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

Scores by School Size

    A table that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).

Scores by School Type

   A table that breaks down school performance based on school type (district or charter).
